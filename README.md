# Bash Shell Script Database Management System (DBMS)

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a simple Database Management System (DBMS) using Bash Shell scripting. The DBMS will allow users to store and retrieve data from their local hard disk through a command-line interface (CLI). The system will be menu-driven, offering various options for managing databases and tables.

- The Tables store in files, which can be CSV or JSON or XML File format
- You can divide the Table info to two tables: Meta-data and Raw Data in separate files or the same file
- When Create Table, The Meta Data of Table will be: Table Name, Number of Columns, Name Of Columns
- There is assumption that First Column is Primary Key, which used for Delete Rows.
